Write a function for determining a king 
is in checkmate.
It should take a 2D 4x4 array as input to 
represent the chess game board as such:
[[‘R’,’-’,’K’,’-’],
 [‘R’,’-’,’-’,’-’],
 [‘-’,’-’,’-’,’-’],
 [‘-’,’-’,’-’,’-’]]
Where K is the king in question,
R are the attacking rooks
B are the attacking bishops
and - is a blank square.
The funtion should return true if the king
is in checkmate.
Otherwise return false.
